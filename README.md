Pushover Push Notifications for Craftbeerpi

This allows you to send any messages that appear in Craftbeerpi to Pushover.

Setup:

1. Install this plugin within CBPI
2. Go to https://pushover.net and set up a user account and create a new app API Token (I suggest adding a logo here on the API settings)
3. Install Pushover app on your device and log in.
4. Input your User Key and API Key (both available from the pushover website) into the Craftbeerpi parameters page (may require a system reboot if parameters not visible).
5. Reboot your system.
6. Everything should now be pushed to your devices.
